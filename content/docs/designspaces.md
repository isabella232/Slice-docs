There is a great deal of jargon in the type development industry.  Terms like "variable font", "design axis", "static instance", and "partial instance" are technical and confusing.  To understand slicing, it is necessary to have a general understanding of the concepts referenced by these terms and how they relate to the space within which the type designer works, the "design space".

## What is a design space?

The Meriam-Webster dictionary includes the following definitions of the English words ["design"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/design) and [‚Äúspace‚Äù](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/space):

> **design**: the arrangement of elements or details in a product or work of art

> **space**: a set of mathematical elements and especially of abstractions of all the points on a line, in a plane, or in physical space

<small>Source: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a></small>

That's a good starting point for our purposes.  Let's combine the terms into a definition of a type design space:

{{< tip >}}
The ‚Äúdesign space‚Äù is an n-dimensional arrangement of typeface elements where the value of n is determined by the number of elements supported in the typeface and the relationships between those elements.

ü§Ø That's pretty abstract stuff.  The following example will hammer this concept home.

## Design space example

When you open a directory of fonts on your computer, you'll likely find a number of files grouped together as a typeface "family". Let's create two imaginary typefaces on your system called "Small Sans" and "Big Sans".  Small Sans includes Regular and Bold fonts.  Big Sans has Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, SemiBold, and ExtraBold fonts. It so happens that the type designers also provide you with Italic forms.  The Small Sans family has Italic and Bold Italic fonts and the Big Sans family includes the full complement of Thin Italic through ExtraBold Italic that pair weight-for-weight with the Roman variants.  But Big Sans takes it one step further (it wasn't called Big Sans for nothing!) and supports a width element so there are also Condensed and Expanded fonts for every Roman, italic, and weight combination.

These are examples of two type design spaces with weight, italic, and width elements.  The elements are known as "design axes" and they define the design space.  Small Sans is a two-axis design space that includes weight and italic elements.  Big Sans is a three-axis design space that includes weight, width, and italic elements.

Design axes have dimensions.  The Regular to Bold weight axis range in Small Sans is smaller than the Thin to Black weight axis range in Big Sans.  The axis dimensions can overlap.  The Small Sans weight range is a subset of the Big Sans weight range.  And the combination of axes and axis dimensions provide the design space with a magnitude.  We think of Big Sans as having a larger design space than the one defined by Small Sans.  Larger design spaces generally support a larger number of potential typeface family styles.  Those potential styles are realized by the type developer who defines relevant parts of the design space for the end user.

## Static instance fonts

Design axes are defined as continuous over the axis range.  This means that there is an axis start point, an axis end point, and all points in between.  Type designers commonly draw forms at the axis extremes and use mathematical modeling to create the intermediate forms between those extremes.  While they may exist, many  intermediate forms are irrelevant.  It is a rare person who needs a partial italic form or a weight that is one axis unit larger than the "Bold" value.

The Small Sans and Big Sans font examples above capture discrete parts of the design space that a type developer decided are the most useful to users.  They could have chosen a weight between the Medium and Bold and called that "Bold", but they didn't.  They chose that exact definition on the weight axis and assigned the "Bold" style name to the font.  

The fonts in these examples are called "static instances" or "static instance fonts".  Here, the term "instance" means that you define discrete loci across all axes within the design space.  It's like taking a knife and slicing across the design axes.  Each point that the knife comes into contact with defines a discrete value on the axis that is part of its instance definition.  A font is prepared with those design axis values and a semantic name is assigned so that a user can understand how the design space was sliced to create the instance.  A "Regular" font has a lighter weight than a "Bold" font.  And a "Bold Italic" font adds a slant and different italic letterforms to the weight defined in the "Bold" font.  These fonts differ based on the use of different discrete axis definition combinations.  The knife took a different path across the design axes for each font.

Static instance fonts are the most common format that you will find in the wild today.

## Variable fonts

Enter variable fonts.

The variable font format is a revolution in font technology that makes the *entire design space* accessible in a single font.  So, all of those named static instance font designs that we discussed above? Yep, they are in there. But variable fonts take it a step further.  They also support interpolated definitions of every point on every axis *between those named instance values*.  Instead of axis instances, a variable font includes a multi-dimensional type design space that becomes increasingly complex as the axis number and axis-axis relationships increases.  Users have access to the full design space and can specify the locations that they want to use.  Variable fonts can greatly magnify the type design palette available to end users and de-emphasize designer instance decisions.

Type developers and font users are taking full advantage of this newfound dynamic axis freedom.  Some variable typefaces include numerous design axes with wide ranges that lead to incredibly expansive typographic expression capabilities in a single variable font file.

The [Roboto Flex project](https://github.com/TypeNetwork/Roboto-Flex) is a great example of a very broad, multi-axis variable design space.  The video below shows the breadth of forms that one variable font can cover.

Variable fonts define default, min, and max design axis values and expose axis settings to users with abbreviated **four character axis tags**.

{{< tip >}}
Tag name casing defines the registered status of the axis. Lower case tags are [registered axis tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxisreg#registered-axis-tags), and include `ital` (italic), `opsz` (optical size), `slnt` (slant), `wdth` (width), and `wght` (weight) axes.  Upper case tags are custom, unregistered axis tags.  There is no difference in the way that a user interacts with these two types of axes in a font.
{{< /tip >}}

Users access an area of the design space in a variable font by defining a numeric value for each design axis tag.  The way that you specify this differs based on where you are using the font.  

### Try a variable font!

Stephen Nixon's Recursive typeface CodePen example allows you to explore a variable font in HTML/CSS by editing CSS settings for the family's slant (`slnt`), casual (`CASL`), cursive (`CRSV`), and monospaced (`MONO`) design axes.  Click the "Run Pen" text in the right side view to see the font in action.  Hover over the text to see the design change according to the CSS definitions in the editor on the left.  The CSS editor is not live on this page.  Click the "Edit on Codepen" link in the top right corner of the CodePen view to dive in and edit the `--MONO`, `--CASL`, `--slnt`, and `--CRSV` axis tag variables on the CodePen site.

For example, change the `<h1>` tag text style by editing the following CSS variable values:

```css
h1 {
  --CASL: 1; 
  --slnt: 0;
  --MONO: 1;
}
```

and change the `<h1>` hover text style animation by editing:

```css
h1:hover {
  --slnt: -7;
  --CRSV: 0;
}
```

When you define those axis values, you make a request for a discrete design space location for use with `h1` heading text.  You can think of this as defining a "static instance" within the dynamic design space in a font.  You can request a different area of the space by setting different axis tag values. As Stephen demonstrates in the CodePen example, it is possible to use multiple design space locations to format different text fields in the document.  This is akin to having a knob for each axis to dial in the exact design that you want from the space.  GUI graphics editors, text editors, and other applications that support variable fonts expose axis settings in a similar fashion.  You'll commonly be presented with the axis tag name and a text box or slider to select the axis value.

{{< tip >}}
What if you don't set a value on an axis?  Every variable font sets a default value on every axis to comply with the OpenType specification for the font format. In most environments, you get the default axis value when you do not explicitly define an axis value.

## Sub-spaces from variable fonts

### How Slice fits into the picture

If you've reached this point, hopefully you have a better understanding of type design spaces, static instances, and how the variable font format differs from the static instance format.  Now we can discuss the role that Slice plays in the use of a variable font design space to generate new font files with different design spaces.

Font compiler technology exists to create a new font from a "sub-space" of a variable font design space.  I like to think of this operation as "slicing" a design space and this is how the application earned its name.  The Slice app is a [fonttools instancer](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools) based GUI tool that allows you to slice a variable font to create new sub-space fonts.  The application supports two types of sub-space output font files.

Static instances are one type of output.  Slice provides a list of available axis tags (and axis names when you hover over the tag) as well as the default, min, and max axis values.  Use these data to define a numeric value within the design space for every axis in the variable font and Slice creates a new static instance font at the location that is specified by your data.

But wait, there is more!  You may want to keep some of the variable axes.  Slice also allows you to create fonts that include combinations of variable and instanced axes.  This type of sub-space file is commonly known as a "partial instance font" because you do not instance all design axes.  So, you might slice a weight and width variable font so that the output file supports the full variable weight axis but includes width defined at an axis instance value of 100 (normal width).

If that sounds like something that you might need to do, see the [Usage](../../docs/usage) docs to learn more about how to use the app to slice your variable fonts!

If you need some motivation to slice fonts, check out the ["Why slice a font?" docs](../../docs/#why-slice-a-font).

And if you need no more guidance, the [Install docs](../../docs/install) are a click away and will show you how to get Slice up and running on your platform.
